We have to add one more column: cases all gloves will be cases 10 in one case .  

2. 
It would be helpful to have an easy feature to change the names of the items (just as the app lets me update the *available amount*.

3. 
Masks, gloves, 3x10 pouches, alginate, and prophy paste (and probably other items) come in cases with varying amounts of product depending on brand+ availability. If we are readjusting/ scanning in the new products, we will need to input the number of items manually as they are delivered in order to keep accurate amounts. Who will be inputting these numbers---- Currently, many disposables are "dropped" off in the back and it may be difficult to keep track of the input of some of these items.

4. 
Multifold towels+ headrest covers+ trays come in a case and are removed as needed, may need to have employee scan that they have "taken a case" once they pull out the last amount of the item from the case.

5. 
It would be helpful to add photos next to QR code if possible.


We donâ€™t touch 3 and 4 for now because I don't understand what the boss wants here, I want to remove it completely.
